# Binary Trees
#### Binary trees are data structure that has atmost two children

1. We can add, remove, or find element in ***O(logn)*** time .
2. **Ordered Storage** (left of node will be smaller than it and right one will be larger) --> Binary Search Tree .
3. Cost Efficient.


#### Where it is used ?
1. File System.
2. Databases.
3. Algorithms in Networking.
4. Solving Mathematical Problems.
5. ML algorithms Decision Trees.
6. Compression of files.

#### Types Of Binary Tree
1. Complete Binary Tree: All levels are completely filled except the last level and the last level is filled from left to right i.e the last level has all nodes as left as possible .

2. Full Binary Tree/Strict BT: Either has 0 or 2 child.

3. Perfect BT: All leaf nodes are at same level.

4. Balanced BT: Average height is log(N).
5. Skewed BT: A skewed binary tree is a pathological/degenerate tree in which the tree is either dominated by the left nodes or the right nodes.
